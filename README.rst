Snowcone  
========

A scalable, semantic @fontface loving icon set, made by Tangent Snowball.

Adding a new icon
----------------- 

**Please note: These instructions have initially been made for our team but give it a go repo cloners and feel free to give feedback on their clarity!**

You'll need 
***********

- A copy of *Glyphs/Glyphs lite* (or Fontforge if you're hardcore, but we'll assume you've got Glyphs).
- **Adobe Illustrator** or a similar vector-based application (instructions assume you have Illustrator).
- Font-squirrel's online **webfont generator** - http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator

Step 1: Create your icon as a vector path
*******************************

- Download the whole Snowcone repo using the *ZIP download* button.
- Open *src/snowcone.ai* in Illustrator.
- Create your new glyph in the same way as the existing ones have been made (keeping within the guides).
- Ensure glyph is a compound path.
- Copy the glyph to your Clipboard.

Step 2: Add your new glyph to the .glyphs file
***********************

- Open *snowcone.glyphs* in glyphs app.
- Double-click an empty character to edit it.
- From the little toolbar at the bottom of the screen, change the glyph's width to *800* (as our icons are square).
- Paste in the glyph you created in Illustrator.   
- If Glyphs asks you to *Correct Bounds* do so. It means it will paste it within the glyph area and not way out there on the pasteboard.

Step 3: Export your glyphs file as a font, then generate a webfont from it

We need to change all glyphs to use PUA (private use area) characters:
