Scalable, semantic @fontface loving icon set for the world of today

This font set has been designed (with love) by the Tangent Snowball team to be an easily adjustable set of icons for use on projects where icons are required. Using a font set ensures all icons are fully scalable and only need one header call. It is currently in its infancy but we'll be expanding it henceforth. 

Icons to do:

external link
document types (music, movie etc...)
calendar
add profile icon
printer
zoom in
map
lighnening bolt
info tooltip
download
upload

To improve:

Link icon

Outstanding issue: encoding each glyph in the PUA (Private Use Area) of the font set:
